## 2025-08-12: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Developer, End Users (Traveling Couple)

### Decision

Develop a focused Thai language learning app specifically for travel preparation, targeting a married couple planning a fall trip to Thailand. The app prioritizes functional conversation skills and Thai script reading through mobile-first vocabulary practice.

### Context

The couple needs practical Thai language skills for their upcoming travel but existing language learning apps are either too academic or don't focus on travel-specific vocabulary. They need a mobile-optimized solution that works offline during travel and provides both spoken and written Thai skills.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Language App (Duolingo/Babbel)**
   - Pros: Established platform, comprehensive curriculum
   - Cons: Not travel-focused, limited Thai script support, requires internet connection

2. **Academic Thai Course**
   - Pros: Comprehensive language foundation, structured learning
   - Cons: Time-intensive, not practical for travel timeline, desktop-focused

3. **Travel Phrasebook App**
   - Pros: Travel-focused content, quick reference
   - Cons: Limited vocabulary, no script learning, no progress tracking

### Rationale

A custom-built app allows us to focus specifically on travel use cases while combining the best aspects of vocabulary learning, script reading, and mobile optimization. The personal nature of the project allows for rapid iteration and feature prioritization based on real user needs.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Highly targeted learning experience optimized for travel scenarios
- Mobile-first design enables learning during commutes and travel
- Thai script integration provides practical reading skills for signs and menus
- Progress tracking gamification encourages consistent daily practice
- PWA capabilities enable offline use during actual travel

**Negative:**
- Limited audience (not scalable to general market without significant changes)
- Single-person development limits feature development speed
- No formal language curriculum validation
- Requires ongoing content curation and audio quality management

## 2025-08-12: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer, End Users

### Decision

Use React 19 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Yarn for package management in a frontend-only architecture with local storage persistence.

### Context

The project needs rapid development with modern web technologies while maintaining mobile performance and offline capabilities for travel use.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **React Native**
   - Pros: Native mobile performance, app store distribution
   - Cons: Additional complexity, deployment requirements, unnecessary for web-first approach

2. **Vue.js or Svelte**
   - Pros: Lighter bundle size, simpler learning curve
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less alignment with organizational standards

3. **Backend Database (PostgreSQL + FastAPI)**
   - Pros: Persistent data, user accounts, cloud sync
   - Cons: Over-engineering for personal project, adds deployment complexity, requires internet for core functionality

### Rationale

React 19 with TypeScript provides type safety and modern development patterns while Tailwind CSS v4 enables rapid UI development. Frontend-only architecture with local storage eliminates backend complexity while still providing data persistence. This stack aligns with organizational standards and enables rapid prototyping.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development and iteration cycles
- No backend infrastructure costs or maintenance
- Offline-first architecture perfect for travel use
- Modern development experience with excellent tooling
- Easy deployment to static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)

**Negative:**
- No user accounts or cross-device sync capability
- Limited to single-device data persistence
- Potential data loss if browser storage is cleared
- Cannot collect usage analytics without additional integration

## 2025-08-12: Mobile-First Design Philosophy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, End Users

### Decision

Prioritize mobile-first responsive design with PWA capabilities for offline use during travel, over desktop-optimized learning experience.

### Context

The target users will primarily use the app on smartphones during commutes, travel preparation, and actual travel in Thailand. Desktop usage is secondary to mobile effectiveness.

### Rationale

Travel language learning happens on-the-go, and the app needs to function without internet during flights and in areas with poor connectivity. Mobile-first design ensures optimal user experience for the primary use case.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal experience on primary usage platform
- PWA capabilities enable app-like experience
- Offline functionality crucial for travel scenarios
- Touch interactions optimized for vocabulary practice

**Negative:**
- Desktop experience may be suboptimal for extended study sessions
- PWA limitations compared to native apps (no app store presence)
- Increased complexity in handling various mobile screen sizes and orientations
