## Pitch

Thai Night Market is a personal Thai language learning app that helps a married couple preparing for travel to Thailand become functionally conversational and read basic Thai script through interactive mobile-first vocabulary practice and pronunciation training.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Travel-focused language learners**: Couples or individuals preparing for trips to Thailand who need practical conversation skills
- **Thai script beginners**: Travelers who want to read basic signs, menus, and text while in Thailand

### User Personas

**Travel Learning Couple** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Travelers/Tourists preparing for Thailand trip
- **Context:** Planning fall trip to Thailand, want to enhance travel experience through language skills
- **Pain Points:** Limited time for formal language classes, need mobile-accessible learning, want functional skills over academic perfection
- **Goals:** Become conversational for travel situations, read basic Thai script, build confidence for real-world interactions

## The Problem

### Limited Practical Thai Learning Resources

Most Thai learning apps focus on academic language rather than practical travel conversation skills. Generic language apps don't prioritize the specific vocabulary and script reading skills needed for navigating Thailand as a tourist.

**Our Solution:** Focused vocabulary sets for travel scenarios with mobile-first design for on-the-go practice.

### Thai Script Reading Barrier

Thai script appears intimidating and inaccessible to Western learners, creating a barrier to reading menus, signs, and basic text during travel.

**Our Solution:** Progressive Thai script learning module that builds from basic characters to practical reading skills.

### Limited Mobile Learning Options

Existing Thai learning tools aren't optimized for mobile learning during travel preparation and real-world use.

**Our Solution:** PWA-capable mobile-first design with offline functionality for learning anywhere.

## Differentiators

### Travel-Specific Vocabulary Focus

Unlike general language learning apps like Duolingo, we provide curated vocabulary sets specifically for travel scenarios including restaurant ordering, transportation, shopping, and emergency situations. This results in faster practical fluency for travel use cases.

### Thai Script Integration

Unlike apps that focus only on romanized Thai, we integrate Thai script learning alongside spoken vocabulary from the beginning. This enables travelers to read menus, signs, and basic text during their trip.

### Mobile-First Travel Design

Unlike desktop-focused language tools, our PWA design with offline capabilities allows learning during commutes, flights, and while actually traveling in Thailand.
